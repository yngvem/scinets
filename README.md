# Code for experimenting with neural image segmentation.
The code used for my masters project about tumour segmentation using deep learning.

The docstrings are unfortunately outdated, so for the documentation, see my thesis.

This was a prototype for how to structure experiments for reproducibility, we currently have a Master's student to rewrite everything from scratch using Keras as backend.
